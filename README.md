The system has the following features:

- Allows to create Estimates with *Dynamic Pricing* (so your customer can simulate the total price selecting/unselecting items)
- Allows sending *Estimates links*
- Allows sending *Estimates to E-mail*
- Allows *printing* Estimates
- Allows *multiple text and price sections* on Estimate (with Dynamic Price or not)
- Allows duplicating Estimates for rapid creation
- Allows changing the Estimate *Currency, Decimal Separator, and Thousands Separator*
- Allows translating to other languages using [Laravel Localization System](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/localization)
